  <p>Many people around the world are doing research on how to improve the Tor
design, what's going on in the Tor network, and more generally on attacks and
defenses for anonymous communication systems. This page summarizes the
resources we provide to help make your Tor research more effective. You can
reach us about research by picking one of the channels listed
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/contact.html">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong>. We've been <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/">collecting data to learn more about the Tor
network</a>: how
many relays and clients there are in the network, what capabilities they
have, how fast the network is, how many clients are connecting via bridges,
what traffic exits the network, etc. We are also developing tools to process
these huge data archives and come up with useful statistics. Let us know what
other information you'd like to see, and we can work with you to help make
sure it gets collected
<a href="https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/#wecsr10measuring-tor">safely</a> and
robustly.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>. If you're investigating Tor, or solving a Tor-related problem,
<em>please</em> talk to us somewhere along the way — the earlier the better. These
days we review too many conference paper submissions that make bad
assumptions and end up solving the wrong problem. Since the Tor protocol and
the Tor network are both moving targets, measuring things without
understanding what's going on behind the scenes is going to result in bad
conclusions. In particular, different groups often unwittingly run a variety
of experiments in parallel, and at the same time we're constantly modifying
the design to try new approaches. If you let us know what you're doing and
what you're trying to learn, we can help you understand what other variables
to expect and how to interpret your results.</li>
<li><strong>Measurement and attack tools</strong>. We're building a repository of tools that
can be used to measure, analyze, or perform attacks on Tor. Many research
groups end up needing to do similar measurements (for example, change the Tor
design in some way and then see if latency improves), and we hope to help
everybody standardize on a few tools and then make them really good. Also,
while there are some really neat Tor attacks that people have published
about, it's hard to track down a copy of the code they used. Let us know if
you have new tools we should list, or improvements to the existing ones. The
more the better, at this stage.</li>
<li><strong>We need defenses too — not just attacks</strong>. Most researchers find it easy
and fun to come up with novel attacks on anonymity systems. We've seen this
result lately in terms of improved congestion attacks, attacks based on
remotely measuring latency or throughput, and so on. Knowing how things can
go wrong is important, and we recognize that the incentives in academia
aren't aligned with spending energy on designing defenses, but it sure would
be great to get more attention to how to address the attacks. We'd love to
help brainstorm about how to make Tor better. As a bonus, your paper might
even end up with a stronger "countermeasures" section.</li>
<li><strong>In-person help</strong>. If you're doing interesting and important Tor research
and need help understanding how the Tor network or design works, interpreting
your data, crafting your experiments, etc, we can send a Tor researcher to
your doorstep. As you might expect, we don't have a lot of free time; but
making sure that research is done in a way that's useful to us is really
important. So let us know, and we'll work something out.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in anonymity research, you must make it to the <a href="https://petsymposium.org/">Privacy
Enhancing Technologies Symposium</a>. Everybody who's
anybody in the anonymity research world will be there. Stipends are generally
available for people whose presence will benefit the community.</p>
<p>To get up to speed on anonymity research, read <a href="https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/">these
papers</a> (especially the ones in boxes). We
also keep a list of <a href="/techreports/">Tor Tech Reports</a> that are (co-)authored by
Tor developers.</p>
